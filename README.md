# QuestPointer

QuestPointer puts the quest POI icons from the world map onto your minimap.

It'll integrate with TomTom's crazyarrow, if you have it installed. Click the broker plugin or type "/qp closest" to have the crazyarrow point to the current closest quest POI.

You can choose to:

 * Track World Quests, too
 * Auto-track the closest POI in TomTom
 * Only show icons for quests you're watching
 * Make icons on the edge of the minimap become arrows to make it more obvious that they're far away
 * Change the icon scale
